# CCashPythonClient
A Python based web-client to assist with utilizing CCash MineCraft
utilities. \
Uses the requests lib to communicate with a remote server. \
Implements python Exception based errors rather than numbers, and
returns JSON data as dictionaries.

## CCash
CCash repository and set-up information can be found
[here](https://GitHub.com/EntireTwix/CCash).

## Documentation
The code for this project is extremely simple and anyone with basic
Python knowledge would be able to write it. Thus, no external
documentation is provided and the class/function markdown
descriptions below each function should suffice to understand the
module.

## Setup
Because this is a small module, it is safe to clone it into your
working directory. Use the following git commands or download
the source code from GitHub.

`git clone https://GitHub.com/FearlessDoggo21/CCashPythonClient`

You will then be able to import the python module.

`import CCashPythonClient as CCash`
